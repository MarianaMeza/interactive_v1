    <h1>Behind the deadliest year in Mexico </h1>
    <h2>In 2017, Mexico recorded its highest homicide rate in years, with a total of 31,902 murders, more than in 2011 at the peak of Mexico’s drug cartel-stoked violence. The death toll is Mexico’s highest since the government began keeping records in 1997, and shot past 2011’s tally of 27,213 homicides. According to the Interior Department, Mexico’s homicide rate this past year equated with 20.5 murders per 100,000 residents; in 2011, that figure was 19.4. The U.S. homicide rate is 5.3 per 100,000. This interactive graph shows the magnitude of the violence crisis in Mexico and relevant patterns behind the thousands of deaths.  </h2>
